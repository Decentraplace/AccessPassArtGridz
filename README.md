React Interface for ACCESSPASSGRIDZ
This project provides a user interface built with React for interacting with the ACCESSPASSGRIDZ contract deployed on Ethereum. It allows users to purchase access passes, color pixels on a grid, and participate in events where rewards are distributed based on activity.

Features
Access Pass Purchase: Users can purchase access passes using ETH or by owning a specific NFT.
Pixel Coloring: Once an access pass is acquired, users can color pixels on a predefined grid.
Event Participation: The interface tracks the number of pixels colored by each user. When a certain number of pixels are colored by all users combined, rewards are distributed to active participants.
Leaderboard: Users can see their total colored pixels and track their ranking on the leaderboard.
